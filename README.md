## Project Overview üîç
A company wants to identify employees with high promotion potential by analyzing historical promotion data alongside factors like performance ratings, training participation, awards, length of service, and demographic information. This predictive approach aims to streamline the promotion process, allowing HR to focus on high-potential candidates, reduce manual evaluation time, and ensure top-performing employees are rewarded appropriately.

The project has two primary goals:

- Develop a Predictive Model to Determine Promotion Likelihood
- Identify Key Factors Influencing Promotions

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential for understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and preparing features for modeling. This project‚Äôs EDA focused on univariate and bivariate analyses to extract  meaningful insights from the data.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in building a reliable predictive model. In this project, the following steps were taken to prepare the dataset for training the promotion prediction model:
  - Handling Missing Values
  - Encoding Categorical Data
  - Feature Scaling
  
### Modelling and Evaluation
**1. Modeling with Default Parameters**

Initially, we built baseline models using default hyperparameters. This step provided a starting point and allowed us to establish benchmark metrics for comparison. Models that will be used :
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- GradientBoosting Classifier

**2. Modeling with Oversampling**
   
  Given the imbalance in the target variable, we applied oversampling techniques to the training set to improve the model's ability to identify the minority class. This step aimed to address class imbalance and improve model performance on the positive class. 

**3. Hyperparameter Tuning**
   
  We performed hyperparameter tuning to enhance the model‚Äôs performance by optimizing key parameters. This step involved experimenting with various parameter combinations to find the best configuration for improved F1 scores.

**4. Threshold Adjustment**
   
  Finally, we adjusted the decision threshold to achieve a balance between precision and recall, optimizing the F1 score.
