## Context
A company with a growing workforce wants to optimize its internal promotion process. The organization is keen to identify employees who are most likely to be promoted based on historical promotion data and various factors such as performance, training, award, service year and demographics. This will help streamline the promotion process, saving time and resources, while ensuring that high-performing employees are rewarded appropriately.

Target :

0 : Employee not promoted

1 : Employee promoted

## Problem Statement
Promoting employees without an effective screening process can lead to inefficiencies, including potential loss of talent and resources. The company wants to improve the promotion process by identifying employees who are likely to be promoted based on data-driven insights. This will allow the organization to focus on retaining top talent, planning for promotions more effectively, and ensuring fairness in the selection process.

## Goals
- Develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of an employee being promoted
- Understand the key factors influencing employee promotions
